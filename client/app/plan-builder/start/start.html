      <b>Welcome to Plan Builder!</b><br>
      This will guide you through all of the things we'll need to help you build your long-term plan.
    </p>

      Before we get started, it's important to know that this may take longer than you think. A comprehensive plan covers everything
      from debts management to retirement savings and ultimately, the more we know, the more we can help.

      There are two easy ways to get started: you can link you mint.com account and we'll ask some clarifying questions from there, or
      you can enter your information into the Plan Builder questionnaire. If you're skeptical or hesitant about the security of your
      personal information, I'd recommend the second option- you don't even need to give us your email to get started there.
